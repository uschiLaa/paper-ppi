abstract: |
  Projection pursuit describes a procedure for searching high-dimensional data for "interesting" low-dimensional projections via the optimization of a criterion function called the projection pursuit index. Most indexes developed focus on finding projections with cluster structure, outliers, or separations between known groups. Here, we are interested in finding projections where the shapes are odd, or where known groups have different shapes despite having the same mean and variance. The new indexes are based on scagnostics, which were originally developed to choose pairs of interesting variables from a large collection. An examination of the properties of the scagnostics is included, and code in the form of an R package is provided.

# Introduction

The term "projection pursuit" was coined by @ff74 to describe a procedure for searching high-(say $p$)dimensional data for "interesting" low- dimensional projections ($k=1$ or $2$ usually). The procedure, originally suggested by @kr69, involves defining a criterion function, or index, that measures the "interestingness" of each $k$-dimensional projection of $p$-dimensional data. This criterion function is optimized over the space of all $k$-dimensional projections of $p$-space, searching for both global and local maxima. It is hoped that the resulting solutions reveal low-dimensional structure in the data not necessarily found by methods such as principal component analysis.

A large number of projection pursuit indices have been developed [@f87] [@CBC92] [@Lee05] [@AHC02] [@CEM:CEM2568] [@JS87] [@5508437]. Many of these are developed to detect departure from multivariate normal, which includes clusters or outliers, or nonlinearity. Some have been developed to detect separations between known groups. However, if one wants to find unusual shapes, or shape differences between groups there are no options. One reason, is that it is hard, because defining what is meant by shape is not straightforward. An approach that seems plausible begins with scagnostics, developed by @scag, and explored in @WW08. 

*** Motivating example ??

Scagnostics are scatterplot diagnostics. They were primarily developed to extract pairs of interesting variables from a large collection.
